I read a ton and have collected an assortment of ideas for productivity and life optimization. These come from books, articles, and Twitter threads. Looking back I wish I would have wrote the source but alas here we are.
Disclaimer: Some of these may be common sense and some of them may be anecdotal. Take what you want and leave the rest.

## Productivity
1. Wear similar outfits every week (Rotation of 14-21 outfits) to reduce decision fatigue.
2. Turn your phone's airplane mode on until lunchtime every day to focus.
3. Get rid of most of your objects and possessions that you don't use on a regular basis (To increase cognitive/attention resources of the brain).
4. Delete all apps on your phone that you don't use regularly (At least every week).
5. Delete all bookmarks on your computer browser that you don't use regularly (At least every week).
6. Clean up your computer desktop of files and organize into folders every quarter.
7. Track what you do with your time every 30min throughout your day for several weeks to eliminate wasted time.
8. Automate, delegate, or eliminate tasks that don't need to be done by you (meal prep, chores, etc): Can use apps like Instacart, TaskRabbit, DoorDash, Upwork, etc for delegating.
9. Reset your dopamine levels by reducing stimulus (Consistently sit quietly alone and let your mind relax).
10. Text an accountability partner daily to ensure you stay on track to achieve your goals.
11. Unsubscribe from all email lists, YouTube subscriptions, podcasts, magazines, social feeds, accounts, etc., and then resubscribe to only 10 of your absolute favorites.
12. Download Google Chrome extensions to increase focus: AdBlock for YouTube, DF Tube (limiter for YouTube), News Feed Eradicator (limiter for Facebook).
13. Write out your Mission/Goals, Your Why statement, your Hourly Schedule, and your Identity/Values on a Google Docs sheet, then print it out and place it in your field of view while you work.
14. Use online digital apps like Google Docs, Google Keep notes, and Notion to manage and organize your personal life all in one place, helps with ease of access on your phone or computer.
15. To do 4 hours of deep work during the day, set a timer to work for 80 minutes then take a 15-minute break, and do this 4 times.
16. Download Freedom.to app and also Webtime Activity Tracker for Google Chrome to block sites during deep work time and also review where most of your screen time is being spent.
## Sleep/Wake
1. Take magnesium glycinate supplements, organic valerian root tea, organic chamomile tea before bed for better REM sleep.
2. No blue light 1 hour before bed (Get blue light blocking glasses) to better produce melatonin.
3. Don't eat 2 hours before bed, don't drink water 1 hour before bed.
4. Wake up at the same time every day to fix circadian rhythm.
5. Get an alarm clock that uses synthetic sunlight to wake you up easily out of your REM state.
6. Get blackout curtains to keep the bedroom very dark or pitch black when sleeping to increase melatonin.
7. Keep your bedroom at a temperature around 72 degrees when sleeping.
8. Get 15min of sunlight within 15min of waking up.
9. Use an Oura Ring or Whoop sleep tracker to monitor your sleep quality score.
10. Wake up no later than 5 am every day.
11. The idea of "catching up" on sleep is flawed. Make sure you get proper sleep every night since it's the most important thing for recovery and healing.
12. Have a consistent wind-down routine to ease yourself into rest mode and getting to sleep faster.
## Nutrition/Exercise/Diet
1. Eat similar meals weekly (Rotation of 7-14 meals).
2. Eat only whole foods that are unprocessed (1 ingredient foods).
3. Drink enough water (about 2-3 Liters per day, 0.5L right after waking up).
4. Drink high-quality "spring water" if you can, it still includes essential minerals real water naturally has in it.
5. Add electrolytes to your water in the morning to rehydrate your body.
6. Exercise for at least 30min per day (preferably in the morning).
7. Stick to a diet/eating plan (no cheat days) that includes enough protein, fats, carbs, vitamins, and minerals for your specific situation.
8. Eat organic natural foods when possible that don't include pesticides when they were farmed or grown.
9. Take a picture of every meal before you eat it to make sure you're consciously aware of the nutrition of your food. It makes you think twice before you consume.
10. Don't do grocery shopping while hungry because it might encourage you to buy unhealthy unnecessary foods.
11. Take a food allergy test to see what foods create inflammation in your body, then avoid those foods.
12. Drink water at least 30min before or 30 minutes after (not during/while) eating a meal, as this helps with improving stomach acid and digestion.
## Mindfulness/Self-Reflection
1. Meditate/pray daily for 10 minutes (5 minutes in the morning and 5min at night) using binaural ambient calming music.
2. Write in a journal for 15min daily (3 things you're grateful for, 3 essential tasks/priorities for tomorrow, and 3 reflections/thoughts about your day).
3. Read non-fiction helpful books regularly related to your goals (About one per month minimum).
4. Visualize a recreated yourself and update your identity to your new goals - How you do anything is how you do everything.
5. Take all Personality Tests and see common similarities between your results. Personality tests include the PrinciplesYou test from Ray Dalio, the Gallup StrengthsFinder 2.0 test, Hexaco test, the Humantrends Sales personality test, Myers Briggs 16 Personalities test.
6. Take a 20-minute bath with 300g+ of magnesium sulfate to relax and ease muscle tension.
7. Practice doubling. Count down from 10, doubling your relaxation level with each count. Surrender in your body.
## Finances
1. Check your bank account daily to keep track of where every dollar goes so it's more intentional.
2. Set a zero-based budget and manage to it.
3. Invest in efficient ways that require low time-cost.
4. If it's speculative it's fun money not an investment. 
5. Index funds win. Period.
## Health/Environment 
1. Get water filters for your shower and refrigerator tap water.
2. Get an EMF (electromagnetic frequency) meter to measure and confirm you're reducing the radiation you interact with as much as possible.
## Social/Relationships
1. Do something social with friends or family at least once a week for connection and community.
2. Host something. Create the community you wish you had.
