# Sylph domain context

## Purpose

Sylph is a minimal, customizable Next.js portfolio and publishing starter. It renders repository-authored posts, examples, and guides as a statically discoverable site with theme-aware MDX, metadata, social cards, and deployment defaults.

## Domain glossary

### Site

The complete generated portfolio and publishing experience, including pages, posts, metadata surfaces, theme behavior, and deployment identity.

### Site profile

The validated canonical identity of a Site: origin, name, description, locale, social defaults, and deployment presentation. Metadata surfaces consume the Site profile instead of assembling identity values independently.

### Favorite

A curated outbound link to an external article or resource. Favorites are a typed, repository-authored list — not Posts, not a Category, and not part of the Content catalog.

### Category

A named collection of Posts exposed at one route segment, such as guides or examples. Categories are repository-authored and must resolve to a deterministic static route inventory.

### Post

A trusted, repository-authored MDX document with validated frontmatter, a Category, a slug, authored timestamps, metadata, and rendered content.

### Content catalog

The module that discovers Categories and Posts and owns content validation, ordering, lookup, adjacency, and the complete route inventory. Routes and metadata surfaces consume this module rather than reading the filesystem directly.

### MDX renderer

The server-side module that transforms trusted Post content into the Site's semantic, theme-aware presentation. Interactive behavior is delegated to small client-side islands.

### Metadata surface

A search, social, or browser-discovery representation of the Site or a Post, including canonical metadata, Open Graph images, Twitter cards, icons, robots policy, and sitemap entries.

### Theme

The system, light, or dark visual state applied to the Site, including Radix color tokens and syntax-highlighting colors. Theme selection persists across navigation and reloads and respects user accessibility preferences.

### Verification

The read-only set of install, formatting, linting, type, test, build, route, metadata, accessibility, and browser checks used to prove the Site from a clean checkout.

## Domain constraints

- Post content is trusted and repository-authored; arbitrary user-controlled MDX is not supported.
- Production routes and metadata surfaces must be deterministic from the Content catalog.
- The Site profile must provide one validated canonical production origin.
- Verification must not rewrite source code or authored Post metadata.
- New seams require a second real adapter or a demonstrated testing need; speculative adapters are avoided.
